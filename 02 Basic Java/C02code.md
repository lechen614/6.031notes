## Basic Java
### Snapshot diagrams
Snapshot diagrams represent the internal state of a program at runtime â€“ its stack (methods in progress and their local variables) and its heap (objects that currently exist).

###  `==` vs. `equals()`
- Use == for comparing primitive values, like ints, chars, and doubles.
- Use equals() for comparing object values, like lists, arrays, strings, and other objects.
